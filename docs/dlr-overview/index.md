***Reading this Document:***

> ***The first section conveys mission, goals, and value propositions for the DLR.***
>
> ***The second section is a bird's eye view of the architecture with a few sentences about each DLR component.***
>
> ***The following sections drill into the major areas and components with conceptual introductions in moderate detail. These sections lift some text from more detailed documents that provide further reading such as samples, API references, etc. There are some sub sections here that are not found in the other documents.***
